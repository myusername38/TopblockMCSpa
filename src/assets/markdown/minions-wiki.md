# Minions 

### What are they
Minions are small robots that will complete simple tasks for you as long as they are fed, and you are online.Each minion has a specific task they will complete. Minions that produce items (Ex. Slayer, Farmer, Collector) will automatically collect the items and place them into the chest of your choice. They can be purchased and view with /minions store. Minions are player specific. Meaning only you can place, change, or remove the minion.
