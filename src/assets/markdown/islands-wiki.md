### Oneblock
OneBlock is an addon for Skyblock that gives a regerating block in the center of your island
Each island is fitted with this special block, however you can select just the OneBlock island for an extra challenge
Upon breaking the OneBlock it will change and level up. Occasionally spawning a chest, but becareful it only shows for a second so be ready to Right-Click
The OneBlock will also spawn live passive and hostile mobs, so make sure you're secured unless they will push you off
