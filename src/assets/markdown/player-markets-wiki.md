# Player Markets

### What are they 
Sell or Buy any items you want in your own personalized Store, with a designated NPC to always make sure youâ€™re taking orders. You can even design your own shop from the ground up to make it as unique as you please. Each Shop has a specific Contract tied to it. Each Contract lasts for a set amount of days and costs a set amount, which both can be found in the GUI before purchasing the store. At the end of your contract, if it is not renewed, your shop will be reset. So make sure to keep on top of your shop!

### Getting Started 
Found a shop you want to buy? Great, setting it up is just as easy. The NPC that is spawned will be the Point of Sale for your shop. Meaning players will click on your NPC to access your shop.

### Upgrading your shop
To Increase the storage of your shop, place a chest inside of your area and the NPC will automatically place the bought items inside. Same thing works for selling items. Place them in the chest and they will be taken from the chest when sold.
